#foreach VAR,LIST,TEXT
# VAR and LIST are expanded
# VAR is set to each item in LIST and TEXT is expanded repeatedly
# so text is expanded $(words LIST) times
# you probably will use VAR each time...
# example:
# words = I love jesus dick
# foreach word,$(words),$(shell echo $(word))
var = <++> # i or something
list = <++>
text = <++>
$(foreach $(var), $(list), $(text))
