# NOTE: You can do multiple globs too with clever mapping
# if you store a glob in a variable and dereference it in a rule,
# it will work UNLESS IT DOESN'T FIND ANY MATCHES, when it will return a
# string literal instead. So we use a convolution.

# storing a glob as a variable (no matches and it returns literally)
#patsubst PATTERN,REPLACEMENT,TEXT # pattern can be %.c for example
#wildcard GLOB
# you might want multiple variables if you have multiple globs you want

GLOB = $(patsubst <++>,<++>,$(wildcard <++>))
<++> : $(GLOB)
	<++>
