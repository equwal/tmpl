Careful to not use GNU "extensions" in your POSIX sed:

no -i
no ; (use a newline)

Plan9 sed has:
sed [ -gln ] [ -e script ] [ -f scriptfile ] [ file ... ]

(range spec)command {args}
! opposite range spec

a\      text on next line
text

i\      text on previous line
txt

c\      replace the line with text (ie. s/^.*$/text/)
text

N join next line

dD delete pattern space, DELETE FIRST LINE IN PATTERN SPACE

hH pattern space->hold space, APPENDING
gG hold space->pattern space, APPENDING
x hold space "exchange" pattern space

pnP print, print and next, PRINT FIRST LINE

= print line number
{} group commands

r {file} read file into output
w {file} write (appending) to file
tb: label jumps

q quit
