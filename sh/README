Portability considerations for shell scratchwork.

For the most part, these are utilities that can be dropped at the top line of
your script, or they show multiple portable options to do it by example.

Editor hint (vim example):
gg     -- goes to top of file.
o<ESC> -- inserts new line
:read /path/to/echo-noarg -- read in a portability function like echo-noarg

etc.
